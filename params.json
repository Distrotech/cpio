{"name":"Cpio","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/cpio.git","body":"This is GNU cpio, a program to manage archives of files.\r\nAs of version 2.0, it supports the features of the System V release 4\r\ncpio, including support for tar archives.\r\n\r\nThis package also includes rmt, the remote tape server, and mt, a tape\r\ndrive control program; these two programs will only be compiled if\r\nyour system supports remote command execution, and tape drive control\r\noperations, respectively.\r\n\r\nSee the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions for Unix.\r\n\r\nFor non-Unix systems [ Note:  The non-Unix makefiles have not been tested\r\n                       for this release ]\r\n\r\nmakefile.pc is a makefile for Turbo C or C++ or Borland C++ on MS-DOS.\r\n\r\nmakefile.os2 is a makefile for MS C and GNU C (emx/gcc) on OS/2.\r\ncpio.def is a linker definition file for the MS C OS/2 version.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main advantages of GNU cpio over Unix versions are:\r\n\r\n* It can access tape drives on other hosts using TCP/IP.\r\n\r\n* `-o' and `-p' can copy symbolic links either as symbolic links or,\r\nwith `-L', as the files they point to.\r\n\r\n* `-i' automatically recognizes the archive format and tries to\r\nrecover from corrupted archives.\r\n\r\n* The output of '-itv' looks like 'ls -l'.\r\n\r\n* It accepts long-named options as well as traditional\r\nsingle-character options.\r\n\r\nA few features of other versions of cpio are missing from GNU cpio, including:\r\n\r\n* The `-6' option to support Sixth Edition Unix cpio archives with `-i'.\r\n\r\n* An option to limit volume size, like afio -s.\r\n\r\n\r\nGNU cpio supports the POSIX.1 \"ustar\" tar format.  GNU tar supports a\r\nsomewhat different, early draft of that format.  That draft format has\r\na slightly different magic number in the tar header and doesn't\r\ninclude the path prefix part of the header, which allows storing file\r\nnames that are longer than 100 characters.  GNU cpio knows to\r\nrecognize the nonstandard GNU tar \"ustar\" archives.\r\n\r\nThe following patch to GNU tar 1.11.1 makes GNU tar recognize standard\r\n\"ustar\" archives, such as GNU cpio produces, except that it won't use\r\nthe path prefix.  Without this patch, GNU tar thinks that standard\r\n\"ustar\" archives are old-format tar archives and can not use the extra\r\ninformation that \"ustar\" format contains.  If you use this patch,\r\nremember that you will lose the beginnings of paths that are longer\r\nthan 100 characters.  That's why it's not an official part of GNU tar.\r\n(Adding support for the path prefix to GNU tar is not trivial.)\r\n\r\n--- list.c.orig Mon Sep 14 17:04:03 1992\r\n+++ list.c      Wed Oct 14 14:02:28 1992\r\n@@ -439,7 +439,7 @@\r\n                st->st_ctime = from_oct(1+12, header->header.ctime);\r\n        }\r\n \r\n-       if (0==strcmp(header->header.magic, TMAGIC)) {\r\n+       if (0==strncmp(header->header.magic, TMAGIC, 5)) {\r\n                /* Unix Standard tar archive */\r\n                *stdp = 1;\r\n                if (wantug) {\r\n\r\nMail suggestions and bug reports for GNU cpio to bug-cpio@gnu.org.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
